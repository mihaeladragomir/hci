To run the application:
	- cd into the LabelMe directory
	- write the following in the terminal:
		java -jar bin/LabelMe.jar


NOTE: We have copied the src and images folders and database file into the bin directory due to an unforseen bug. We are aware that this is not the standard way of doing packaging
